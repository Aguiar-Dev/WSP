			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>My name is Fernando Luis Aguiar Guevarez, I am 19 years old and am currently studying to become a Web Designer/Developer. I am from Puerto Rico, moved to the U.S. two years ago with most of my family in order to finish my high school years over there. After I graduated I decided to come to Full Sail to study Game Development, after a while I decided that I preferred other types of development, therefore I changed to Web Development. I am an avid gamer and social person who enjoys both spending time with family and friends, and playing games to my hearts content. My favorite food is fried cod fritters.</p>

					<h3>What do I hope to learn?</h3>
					<p>How to make a more stylish and interactive header. I want to learn how to make headers that not only will captivate my users, but will also fall into the flow of the page, just like this header. From this one in particular I want to learn how I can include geometrical shapes like the triangular design used here into my own components.</p>
					<h3>How does this relates to what I've learned?</h3>
					<p>This is very similar to how we have made headers in previous classes, but it differs from the level of complexity, seeing as prior headers have been in a much simpler scale, this one on the other hand is far better designed than previous headers that I have made.</p>

					<h3>How I might build this?</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Header tag to encompass the entire header, both logo and navigation.</li>
						<li>The logo and navigation will be held in seperate section tag.</li>
						<li>The logo will be an img tag with a custom made logo in adobe illustrator/photoshop.</li>
						<li>The Navigation will be an unordered list tag with the appropriate amount of list items.</li>
						<li>The social links will be put in a seperate section which will be positioned absolutely.</li>

				<div>
					<h3>What do I hope to learn?</h3>
					<p>I hope to learn how to make more effective CTA's that not only capture my audiences attention but also gives them an incentive to realize an action. With this I can further my understanding on how to make prominent CTA's that dont take too much of the users attention but merit the appropriate amount. From this perspective I will be able to create useful CTA's in mere minutes.</p>
					<h3>How does this relates to what I've learned?</h3>
					<p>In my previous courses I have had to make CTA's but never have I had to focus much on how it looked and what they were supposed to do, in this course however I will have to learn how they work and how to use them appropriately. The only other instance in which I have made an effective CTA was for a Bootstrap website in which the CTA was inviting the user to click on a green button.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>What do I hope to learn?</h3>
					<p>I want to learn how to make a more organized features section in which I can keep adding new features constantly, but never make the page feel crowded or overwhelming to the user. With this one I am sure that I will be able to make a prominent features section which looks both organized and stylish. This will also help me learn how to encapsulate code in my HTML.</p>
					<h3>How does this relates to what I've learned?</h3>
					<p>I have never had any prior experience with making a features section and since this would be my first experience I wanted to choose something which would look both stylish and organized, seeing as I prefer most things to be that way.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>What do I hope to learn?</h3>
					<p>How to make an effective footer that can help a lost user find their way around my webpages and feel at ease while using it. I don't want to make footers that have countless links jumbled up making them look cluttered and unorganized, I want to learn how to make organized and effective Footers. With this one I can learn to make footers that are both simple yet extremely effective.</p>
					<h3>How does this relates to what I've learned?</h3>
					<p>Since I started studying Web Development I have never worried about what my footers contained, since I usually placed a simple tag in them specifying that the website had been made by me. As for other websites that I have made which contain footers with actual links they are usually very messy.</p>

				<img src="images/About.png" alt="About Image"/>
				<div>
					<h3>What do I hope to learn?</h3>
					<p>With this component I want to learn how to make an effective About section in which I can inform the user on what this page is about and what they can expect to get out of it. This will also help me make sleek and neat about components in the future. Also I want to learn how to make better decisions on what fonts to use and when to use them, for example on this about page they use very different fonts but they complement each other quite nicely.</p>
					<h3>How does this relates to what I've learned?</h3>
					<p>I have never had to make an About component that was supposed to inform the user on anything important seeing as most of my websites have been simple project at Full Sail, but now I have to focus on the Big picture and as to why I am learning these components.</p>
